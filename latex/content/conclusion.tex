In conclusion, while our study on the EATD-Corpus provides valuable insights into the potential of depression detection using acoustic features, the modest performance of our approach underscores the need for more sophisticated preprocessing techniques and algorithmic frameworks tailored to the complexities of underlying data. Future research efforts should focus on developing robust methods for data preprocessing, feature selection, and data imbalance to unlock the full potential of EATD-Corpus in identifying potentially depressed individuals.
